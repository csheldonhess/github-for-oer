Using GitHub to support OERs
============================

This, right here, is technically an OER, developed and shared via GitHub. It's not fancy, but they don't all have to be, do they?

What is GitHub?
---------------

Originally created to help people share and build on each other's code, GitHub is what's known as a "version control" system. Version control solves this problem:

Additionally, GitHub solves the problem of keeping your projects safe&mdash;backed up to the cloud&mdash;and making it easy* to share and collaborate on with other people.

GitHub is only one of the many version control solutions available, but it's probably the most popular, not only with programmers, but with academics of all stripes (technical and non-technical). It has apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

* OK, it takes a few hours to really get down how it works, maybe a full day to get to the point where you're comfortable enough with it to collaborate on a bigger project. There's a learning curve, but it's like anything: easy once you know how to do it.

The 4-6 R's
-----------
(Definitions for the first five are from [OpenContent.org](https://opencontent.org/definition/))

* **Retain** - the right to make, own, and control copies of the content (e.g., download, duplicate, store, and manage) 
* **Reuse** - the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
* **Revise** - the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
* **Remix** - the right to combine the original or revised content with other material to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
* **Redistribute** - the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)
* **[Request updates](https://boffosocko.com/2018/08/30/the-sixth-r-of-open-educational-resources-oer/)**

### GitHub's answers to the R's:
* Stores content locally to your machine(s) and also in the cloud
* Easy for others to download and duplicate from your GitHub page - can access and download a whole project or any subset of it from any internet-connected machine
* You (or others, with your approval) can make updates from any machine with Git installed
* A single project on GitHub can pull in other people's content from GitHub, add links to Google Docs, add images and videos, and generally mix and match content as needed
* While Git's version control is most powerful with text content (including text files, source code, data in CSV and other "flat" formats, and Markdown), you can add any kind of file to GitHub, including raw video or other formats you might want to allow others to download and remix into new projects.
* If you choose to make your content public, it's indexed by Google and discoverable by other people who are working on similar things
* Some attribution is done automatically, by tracking "forks" from one project to another
* People can file "bug reports" on your projects, and they can offer updates that the project owner(s) can accept or reject
* Changes are tracked over time, and you can look at the history of a project -- and even go back to a previous version, if you care to do so
